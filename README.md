# ⚠️ SYSTEM INSTRUCTION (PROJECT RULES) ⚠️

**Project Status: REFERENCE ONLY**

This project (`voyager-ai-smart-travel-planner`) serves as the **Gold Standard Reference** for UI and Logic.

1.  **NO CODING:** Do not modify code in this project unless explicitly instructed to "fix the reference project".
2.  **"WEB VERSION" MEANING:** If the user asks to "update the web version" or "fix web bugs", they are referring to the **React Native Web build** in the `../voyager-mobile` directory (running on port 8081).
3.  **REDIRECT:** If you are here to implement features, you are likely in the wrong place. Please check `d:/Work/VoyagerAI/voyager-mobile/`.
